# Supernova
## In order to expedite the book buying decision making process, our product will solve the book loversâ€™ problem of spending hours picking what book to buy.
## By giving people a mobile application that can scan a book and display its reviews, we hope that people will be better able to judge whether or not a book is suitable to their tastes.
## The application will also display the New York Times Best Sellers List and give the user information about Book Signing Events.This will help keep them informed and up to date with the latest book news.
